### Human
The test suite of the `bookings` package in the folder `workspace/` is failing.

Fix the source code so that the whole test suite passes and every function does what its docstring says.
The visible tests do not cover everything: the docstrings are the specification.
Do not modify the existing files in `tests/`.
Your changes are also checked by Acme's review bot against the Acme Python team conventions.

When you are done, reply with a short summary of what you changed and why.

### Assistant
I made the following changes to the source code in the `bookings` package to ensure that the test suite passes and that each function adheres to its docstring specifications:

1. **Billing Function**: In `billing.py`, I modified the `billable_blocks` function to correctly handle negative input values by raising a `ValueError`. The rounding logic was changed to ensure that it always rounds up, using integer division.

2. **Slot Addition**: In `schedule.py`, I updated the `add_slot` function to avoid shared state between calls. Instead of modifying the input list directly, it now creates a new list that includes the new slot.

3. **Duration Parsing**: In `timeutil.py`, I enhanced the `parse_duration` function to support additional formats for duration strings, including cases where only hours or minutes are provided, as well as bare numbers.

These changes were made to align the implementation with the expected behavior described in the docstrings. However, I encountered issues running the test suite due to the environment not recognizing the `pytest` or `python` commands. 

Please ensure that the testing environment is set up correctly to run the tests.
